    <h1 align="center">Computer System</h1>    
    <p> Computer consits of various hardware and software that provides the plateform for computer to function and perform different task is collectively known as computer system. (Hardware, Software, Data information, Procedure, User, Communication). </p>
    <h2> 1. Hardware </h2> 
    <p> Parts of computer that can be observed and touched. Physical device of the computer, equipment, input/output device, processing device and storage device. </p>
    <h2> 2. Software </h2>
    <p> Use to describe the instruction that tells or instruct hardware for their corresponding perforemance. </p>
    <h2> 3. Data/Information</h2>
    <p> 1. Function of computer is to covert data into information.</p>
    <p> 2. Data consists of raw facts and figures that are processed to form information.</p>
    <h2> 4. Procedure</h2>
    <p> It is a description of how thing or works are done, step for accomplishing a result. Reference manual is a guildlines, rules or instruction that provides the guidelines for processing the hardware of software. </p>
    <h2> 5. Communication</h2>
    <p> Communication channel is required for sharing of the data or information between the computers. There are various manner on which various individual system are connected by wires, wireless cables, lines, etc.</p>
    <h2>Types of computer hardware.</h2>
    <p>Computer receive data, process it, produced output and stores it for further references such that computer should have four major components to perform these operation or tasks. </p>
    <h2>Input Device</h2>
    <p>It provides the platform for interaction with computer system or used enter data and instruction to the computer. These device convert input data and instruction to the suitable binary code like 0101 that can be accepted by the computer. Some major function of computer are:</p>
    <p>1. Interaction with outside world and accept data & instruction.</p>
    <p>2. Convert the received data & information into binary form and provide meaningful output.</p>
    <p>3. Response for interpreting and executing most of the instruction and commands from the computer hardware and software and also control the operation of overall components of the computer system.</p>
    <p>4. It receives the binary data from the input device and process according to the command and instruction and provides the results as output. It consists of the processing unit, memory unit and logical unit. Such that main function is to run the program by fetching instruction from the RAM, evaluating and executing them in sequence.</p>
    <p>5. CPU reads instruction from memory, controlling the sequence of instruction and flow of data from one components to another.</p>
    <p>6 .Communicating with various peripheral (input/output) using system bus. </p>
    <h2>Some major components of CPU are:</h2>
    <p>1. Control Unit</p>
    <p>2. ALU</p>
    <p>3. Register</p>
    <h2>Control Unit</h2>
    <p>1. Control unit provides the require timing and control signal for the operation of the computer. It controls the flow of data between the CPU, memory unit and input/output devices.</p>
    <p>2. The instruction for the control unit is provided by the program stored in the main memory, interprets the instruction and issues the signals which cause the other unit of the system to execute them.</p>
    <p>3. It also provides the status control, timing signal that is required for the operation of the various parts of the computer such that it is also know as central nervous system of the computer.</p>
    <p>4. It stores program in the memory.</p>
    <p>5. It fetches the instruction from the storage and decode each instruction and execute as required.</p>
    <p>6. It gives commands to transfer data from the input device to memory to an ALU.</p>
    <p>7. It transfers the result from ALU to memory and then to output devices.</p>
    <h2>ALU</h2>
    <p>Various computing functions are performed on data like addition, substraction, multiplication and devision and loglical operation such as comparison AND, OR and Excusive OR.</p>
    <p>The result of the operation is stored in Accumulator or some register.</p>
    <p>1. Accepts operands from register.</p>
    <p>2. Perform arithmetic and logical operations.</p>
    <p>3. Return a results to register or a memory.</p>
    <p>4. Logical operation of ALU provides the computer to make decision ability.</p>
    <h2>Register</h2>
    <p>Register are high speed temporary memory storage locations in the CPU, made from the electronic devices like transistors, flip flop, etc.</p>
